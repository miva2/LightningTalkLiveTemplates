# Lightning Talk Live Templates
Code examples and presentation shown during the Lightning Talk at Ordina on 28/05/2019

You can retrace my steps of the live demo by following the instructions in comments.
The code can be found in the `src/main/java folder`. I suggest starting at `SomeDefaultExamples.java`.

`CustomLiveTemplateExamples.txt` contains instructions on how to create own Live Templates and the code for the Live Templates used during the presentation.

The short presentation can be viewed here: https://miva2.github.io/LightningTalkLiveTemplates/  
The presentation is created with revealJs and can be found under `presentation/index.html`  
or in the `gh-pages` branch which takes care of the hosting on Github Pages.
