Live Templates I created
========================

These are some examples of live templates I created and used.
You might notice I especially like the surround templates.

Add new templates by going to Preferences > Editor > Live Templates.
Add a new Live Template or Template Group by clicking the + button on the upper right.
Add an abbrevation, the shortcut used to trigger the live template.
Add a description which explains what the live template does.
Add the template text, the code generated when using the template.
Edit the "Applicable in" to tell where the live template can be used.
If needed, edit the variables by pressing the edit variables button.

tip: I prefix my custom template groups with _ so I can easily find them on top in the list of templates.


In Java files:

    A simple Live Template to show as example during the presentation.

        void $METHOD_NAME$(){
            $END$
        }

In Kotlin files:

    Below template is used in the kotlin.kt example file.
    I used in on a project when translating a whole bunch of java model classes to kotlin data classes.
    I use it by selecting the annotation past the @ symbol.
    This can probably be optimised but it worked wel for my case.
    shortcut: cmd + alt + t, a

        param:$SELECTION$
        @field:$SELECTION$



    Template for jsoncreator annotation. Used to create secondary constructors in kotlin data classes.

        @JsonCreator constructor (
        $END$)

In JWorks blog files:

    Custom templates used when writing blog posts for our Jworks blog: https://ordina-jworks.github.io/

    Simple template used to surrounds the selected code with a highlight codeblock.
    The "javascript" could be made into a variable to make it more flexible. This was not needed in my usecase.

        {% highlight javascript %}
        $SELECTION$
        {% endhighlight %}

    Easy way to write markdown urls.
    Can be optimized by using a variable instead of $SELECTION$ to show text instead of the full url.
    The url variable could by default be the selected text.

        [$SELECTION$]($url$)
